## Simple Examples for the  Compound-Group "LOOP" ##

- main.cpp              
    is the main entry point.

- ascishapes.hpp        
    contains a declaration of functions to print simple asciishapes.

- ascishapes.cpp        
    prints simple ascishapes using LOOP-compounds.
- ascishapes_old_sytle  
  contains similar fnctions like ascishapes.cpp, but uses FOR(;;) instead of LOOP()-compounds.

- matrix_io.hpp         
    contains functions to print native double 2D-Arrays (matrices) of given size.
- matrix.hpp            
    header-only functions to operate on the matrcies as descrtibed above.  
- example_matrix.cpp    
    example calls to the functions of  matrix.hpp and matrix_io.hpp.
    is invoked by main.cpp.
