## Simple Examples for the  Compound-Group "LOOP" ##

- ascishapes.hpp        declaration of functions to printing simple asciishapes
- main.cpp              the main entry pooint
- ascishapes.cpp        print simple ascishapes using LOOP-compounds
- ascishapes_old_sytle  same as ascishapes.cpp, but uses FOR(;;) instead of LOOP()-compounds


- matrix_io.hpp         functions to print native double 2D-Arrays (matrices) of given size 
- matrix.hpp            functions to operate on the matrcies as descrtibed above  
- example_matrix.cpp    example calls functions in matrix.cpp ( is invoked by main.cpp )
