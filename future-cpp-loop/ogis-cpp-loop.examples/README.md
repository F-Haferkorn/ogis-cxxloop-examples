## Simple Examples for the  Compound-Group "LOOP" ##

- ascishapes.hpp        
    contains a declaration of functions to printing simple asciishapes
- main.cpp              
    is the main entry pooint
- ascishapes.cpp        
    prints simple ascishapes using LOOP-compounds
- ascishapes_old_sytle  
  is the same as ascishapes.cpp, but uses FOR(;;) instead of LOOP()-compounds


- matrix_io.hpp         
    contains functions to print native double 2D-Arrays (matrices) of given size 
- matrix.hpp            
    header-only functions to operate on the matrcies as descrtibed above  
- example_matrix.cpp    
    example calls functions in matrix.cpp ( is invoked by main.cpp )
